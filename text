Courses
We are one the pioneers in implementing CADD (Computer Aided Design & Drafting) concept in Kerala in 1993. CADPOINT is a “work based” animation & multimedia training institute in Kerala offering classroom coaching classes to animation, multimedia students, architecture students, teachers, interior designers, Mechanical & Electrical Engineers… etc. The courses are not just job oriented but job enhancing as well.

CADPOINT training centre is one of its kind training centre in India as it has a client centric approach. Most of the training institutes focus on teaching students on basic commands of the software and have an approach to “go by the book”. Our work based methodology helps the students to understand the client’s requirement and thereby helping them train on specific softwares so that they are fully equipped to independently handle client requirement.

CADPOINT creates a world-class environment for every kind of media business, which broadly includes media and marketing services, printing and publishing, music, film, new media, leisure and entertainment, broadcasting and information. CADPOINT has evolved strength, by meeting the challenge of the global village and further empowering our educational and practical training programmes in order to make them more responsive to the market realities.
